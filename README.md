# switcher_color_squares

## Demo project
* Technologies: html, css, js.
* Colors of squares are switched by buttons

## Ideas to demonstrate
* different alignment of buttons and square field
  * combination of "flex", "inline-block" modes
* use of table tag to organize the whole layout
  * "border-collapse" property 
* difference between absolute px points and relative vh, vw units
  * use of percents for width and height
* onClick attribute of button, details of setting callback functions on pure JS
* use addEventListener to bind events with event-processing callbacks
* put text with vertical orientation on a button
  * if you don't want to have troubles, use nested span
